# Covid-Portfolio-project
EDA with SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

It's been divided in two separated Excel files to create two separate tables and link them using SQL queries.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore the data on Covid deaths and cases to get a global vue and also focusing in the figures of countries of interest (France - as it's my country
of residence, China, India, USA, UK).

## Tableau

After the exploratory queries on the data, I created a few SQL views. Then I selected some of them to create a simple Dashboard in Tableau Public.
